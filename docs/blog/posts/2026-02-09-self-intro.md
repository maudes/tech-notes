# Hello World! It's Maude from Taiwan.
Hi there, I'm Maude. This is the place where I jot down learning notes, insights, architectural deep dives, and technical hurdles I've encountered in the world of wireless networking, IoT, and software development.

### My "Previous Life" as a Curious Tech Journalist

I began my career as a journalist, largely because writing is my strength (specifically in my native language) and I majored in Journalism at university.

I was fortunate enough to start my reporting career on the tech beat. This gave me the chance to dive into topics I never would have explored as a non-STEM student. I wasn't just comparing the pros and cons of the latest iPhone and Android phones; I was witnessing how software changes the world. Along the way, I learned about Cloud computing, Big Data, IoT, and AI. These stopped being just buzzwords and became real tools for solving problems. This curiosity eventually inspired me to start learning how to code.

After four years in the media industry, I decided to pivot my career toward Software Product Management.

### My "After Life" as a Software Product Manager 

This is definitely not an easy journey, yet a challenging and grateful one. I met many people who are willing to give me a chance and support me to be a better product manager. I also encountered skepticism from those who prioritize traditional CS degrees over diverse backgrounds.

Imposter syndrome has been a constant companion on this journey. It's crucial to navigate through and keep moving forward. 

Looking back on my footprints:

* Joined workshops like RoR, Laravel
* Gained experience through internships and side-projects including SALASUSU and SmallSomebody
* Got hired as a software PM for the first time thanks to the referring of colleagues
* Earned the chance to work at Signify (previously Philips Lighting) in Hong Kong, exploring the world of IoT

All these experiences have nurtured my growth and pushed me to go further. In 2024/25, I left Signify because I don't want to stay in the comfort zone. I took a rest and attended a hackathon and startup contest. I learned and worked with my teammates as a backend developer/ PM. I started to rethink my career so far.

### Next Step
Now, I'm working in the CPE OEM industry to gain a deeper, ground-level understanding of networking infrastructure. You might wonder: why dive into the world of CPE and OEM hardware? 

For me, the answer is simple: Software is where the magic happens, but Hardware is where the reality begins. To build truly robust IoT solutions and seamless software experiences, I need to understand the "pipes" they run on. However, my heart remains firmly in the software realm. I believe that code is the ultimate tool for breaking limitations and turning hardware into something alive.

This blog is my commitment to that belief. Here, I’ll document how I’m navigating the complexities of networking, always with the goal of building more intuitive, powerful software products.

Thanks for being part of my "After Life" journey. Let’s decode the world, one line of code at a time.
